This is a front-end application with AngularJS that presents the users with a textbox where they can list comma-separated items they usually eat for lunch. Once that's entered, the user has to click the "Check If Too Much" button.

If the number of items in the textbox is less than or equal to 3 (e.g., 1, 2, or 3), a message shows up under to the textbox saying "Enjoy!". If the number of items is greater than 3 (4, 5, and above), the message "Too much!" shows up under the textbox.
  
If the textbox is empty and the user clicks the "Check If Too Much" button, the message "Please enter data first" shows up.
